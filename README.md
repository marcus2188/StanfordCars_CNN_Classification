# StanfordCars_CNN_Classification
A series of state-of-the-art neural network architectures built to do fine-grained car make classification.
Dataset used is the Stanford Cars Dataset as derived from: https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html .
Below shows a summary of the files inside this repository.
* A directory called "devkit" containing matlab files of label mappings of images
* Jupyter Notebook "Image_preprocessing.ipynb" creates new neater working directories
* Jupyter Notebook "InceptionV3_custom_model.ipynb" implements a custom built inception V3 model from GoogLeNet
* Jupyter Notebook "ResNet50_best_model.ipynb" is using a Keras resnet50 pre-built model to score about 83%.
* Requirements.txt is a document for instructions to run this repository's code if needed
