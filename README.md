# StanfordCars_CNN_Classification
A series of state-of-the-art neural network architectures built to do fine-grained car make classification.
Dataset used is the Stanford Cars Dataset as derived from: https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html .
Below shows a summary of the files inside this repository.
* A directory called "devkit" containing matlab files of label mappings of images
* Jupyter Notebook "Image_preprocessing.ipynb" which creates new neater working directories
* "GoogLeNet_InceptionV3.ipynb" is a googlenet implementation that scores roughly 80% testing accuracy.
